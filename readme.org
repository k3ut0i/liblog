* C Logging Library
  A simple logging library to use in my c projects.

** features
- color distinction between different log levels needed.
- functionality tests when using with libreadline and ncurses.
**  design problems
1. How does the shared state work when my program forks after initializing the library?
2. Care needed to be taken when designing a re-entrant library, and can a logging library be re-entrant?
